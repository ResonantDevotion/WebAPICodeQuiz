# WebAPICodeQuiz

User Story:
AS A coding boot camp student I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Description 

This project was intended to go over our learnings of the week which involved Javascript eventlisteners, using local storage, using timers/countdown, as well as building on our other JS knowledge such as methods, arrays.

I found this project quite tricky as I didnt have much time to go over what we had learnt and also apply it to the project. 
However, it is interesting to add functionality and interactivity to the HTML, as well as use different html pages, which we haven't done before.
